    "So far, all of the analysis we've done has been pretty generic - looking at counts, creating scatter plots, etc. These techniques could be applied to numeric data as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to text data, there are a few popular techniques that we'll be going through in the next few notebooks, starting with sentiment analysis. A few key points to remember with sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **TextBlob Module:** Linguistic researchers have labeled the sentiment of words based on their domain expertise. Sentiment of words can vary based on where it is in a sentence. The TextBlob module allows us to take advantage of these labels.\n",
    "2. **Sentiment Labels:** Each word in a corpus is labeled in terms of polarity and subjectivity (there are more labels as well, but we're going to ignore them for now). A corpus' sentiment is the average of these.\n",
    "   * **Polarity**: How positive or negative a word is. -1 is very negative. +1 is very positive.\n",
    "   * **Subjectivity**: How subjective, or opinionated a word is. 0 is fact. +1 is very much an opinion.\n",
    "\n",

       "[[\"Amazing and beautiful place to stay : We went as a family, the rooms allocated to us were connected, they had taken care of that. Both the rooms offered scenic views. Overall the staff were very courteous and friendly. Also the property was very well maintained and scenic. Tea County Munnar : Nice facilities and good arrangement Staff are very courteous Amazing services and gentle behaviour : Must stay! Overall a very pleasant stay! Highly recommended for families Excellent Stay : Wonderful property, excellent location, excellent view and very nicely maintained. Except for food quality stay was great. Excellent Stay : Very nice good hotel with location. Near market near and clean. Excellent place to stay : We had a great time there. All the staffs had a happy to help attitude. The premises itself is well maintained, have beautiful garden and good for a brief walk. Safe place to stay. Very easy to find and reach there. Simple and sober : Location is very near to City and views are great with garden. The room service is great and people are very friendly Excellent property at a beautiful location : Neat and clean room with all modern amenities. Nicely maintained garden with variety of flowers. Well decorated dining hall with mouth watering foods. Pleasant stay : Had an amazing stay here at Ktdc. Worth every penny. Very nice location, polite staff and great premises : Will definitely recommend because of the location, just walking distance from the market. Very beautiful premises gives a very graceful and premium ambience. Billiards was a unique thing, you won't find it in many hotels. Good staff and nice views from the balcony. Conveniently located to cover Devikulam Tea estates, and Mathupetty area. Good hotel : Overall a good hotel to stay at. Neat and clean. Ktdc need to renovate bathrooms completely. Worth your money : Peaceful and serene stay. One of the best hotel properties in Munnar. You might find some better hotels as well but those would be far from Munnar town. This is in the heart of the town and gives you good options for market, taxi, shopping etc. Breakfast options were average, and could be better. Rooms have a wide range with different facade and view. Interiors are decent in almost all of them. Place is really a value for money. Go for it. Excellent location, good service : We stayed as a group. The location is near to Munnar town. Staff are very courteous. Rooms has a nice view. Breakfast was good. Good parking space. All in all, value for money. Most memorable trip : Celebrating our first anniversary in God's own country Kerala with amazing place, interiors, ambience, food, service, and the beautiful rooms. It truly turned out to be one of its special moment and amazing place. Tea County Munnar : Excellent service by the staffs, perfect location. Issue with hotel : Hotel was nice even service\",\n",
       "  \" plus staff. Only issue which we want to highlight is hotel infrastructure was not upto mark. Don't think it deserve 3 star.

Landscape is beautiful and well maintained. Rooms are spacious and cozy. Bathrooms could have been bigger though. Accommodation and location : Good property, but the new Premium rooms are at the far ends, and the staff gives a damn even if you request in advance for a room with a good view or in the central part of the resort. Although my room was changed after arrival, I was sent to the farthest end of the hotel. Good Stay : Nice ambiance, well maintained rooms.

Food and services were very good. Will stay again. Munnar short stay : First time at Tea County. Good location, good rooms. But only problem that one has to walk a long distance to the rooms. Difficult if you have elders. Had some issues in toilet as water came from the bath partition to the main area while bathing and wastebasket in toilet was old and not properly working. Another main issue was of the staff behavior in restaurant. The guy who was preparing live egg items and appam was ill-mannered. All rates especially those in government-run institutions are like this only. Wifi connectivity was also a problem. Stay at Tea County : Absolutely charming stay at Tea County. KTDC stay 2 days : Location is best, I will rate it very highly for service, cleanliness. Little downside is buffet breakfast as its basically Kerala and only choice you have is cornflakes, bread, butter if you are vegetarian also its little over priced but nice experience.

       "  ' facility and cottages. Highly recommended, as number one choice in Munnar. Don\\'t prefer this property : Location is good but service, cleanliness are poor. Their towels, napkins are of worst quality. They give us a single napkin for a family of 4. There were three big lizards in bathroom. There are no complimentary breakfast here. They say that \"breakfast is complimentary!\" but it\\'s not true. They charged me extra rupees for my 8 year old daughter and for 13 year daughter. Not at all value for money. Perfect location : This property is very near to the Town and has very beautifully maintained. Staff are very friendly and they make you feel special. Food in their restaurant is bit costly however if you compare with quality served in other restaurants in the City its good. For all my upcoming Munnar this property is fixed. Loved the scenic beauty in this resort and spent relaxed time. Highly recommended for those who are travelling with family and small kids. Luxury with budget. We had a great time.

Service is very good : This is a beautiful resort maintained by Ktdc I was very happy to See the standards maintained by the staff. I enjoyed my stay in the Tea County Munnar. Good resort : The resort is situated near the market and very easy to reach market for shopping. Best places to stay in Munnar : This was our first time to stay at a KTDC resort so we were initially a little skeptical but the location of the hotel, the cleanliness, the decor, gardens and landscaping all were more than expected. It is very near to the main market area. It is centrally located. Food variety is sufficient for North Indians and the breakfast spread is elaborate. Rooms themselves were well equipped with bath tubs, heater and the room themselves were cottage style quite spacious. The premises i',\n",

Review : Good property for your stay at Munnar. Service is prompt as well Property is good but poor room maintenance : Stay was memorable. Location and the resort build was so nice.

Aesthetic property with great hospitality blended with authentic kerala cuisine : A warm welcome, great ambience, excellent property at Munnar Town, room was awesome, can spend more time at the hotel itself since its landscaping and garden were exotic.

Though food variety is limited, but it tastes awesome. Moreover buffet menu were some what veg base and the non veg was excellent though numbered less.

All service staff were behaved well. Overall it was nice experience. Poor Stay : We had booked 1 day stay with all meal plan (breakfast, lunch, dinner included). Booking mail even mentioned mineral water included. At check in, the reception staff told me either lunch or dinner will be included. After showing the booking details in mail, he discussed with his senior and included lunch. At night there was power failure thrice without any back up power supply. No hot water in bathroom. Water was just warm. Next morning in breakfast - most of the items were finished when we went at 9:40 am. Only few items replenished. Most of the items were cold. There was no drinking water so we asked for it. They gave a bottle of mineral water but at the check out they charged me for mineral water which I paid. I was given explanation that mineral water is chargeable. I showed him my booking mail, which clearly mentions all meals paid for and mineral water included. Then came a new explanation - mineral water is free in room and not in restaurant. That means - breakfast is free and not water. By that time we were fed up and left after paying the amount. Excellent service! : The hotel staff was pleasing and awesome. They were kind and helpful. The restaurant staff were very presentable and served with happiness. Fine stay and dine : Excellent accommodation and ambiance. A resort waiting to be explored. : Beautiful resort with a lot of potentials.

Again we will plan to stay with my family and relations. Good hotel and nice location : The location and the ambience in the resort is nice. But they don't have lifts we have to always climb lots of stairs to reach rooms, so not suitable for elderly people. Also the path to rooms are filled with grass and not well lit. In that same path I saw snake moving during daytime. So the place is quite scary at night not very safe. Overall it's good, provided they address this safety factor. Very bad : Not Worth going it's too bad.

Tea county is good but not worth money : The room service and amenities are good but compared to the price its not enough. Nice foods and the view from room is also good. But the price is too high. Not worth money, room amenities are good but compared to the price its not up to the mark. Average Stay : The gym is non-functional. It should not be advertised as included in amenities. It's extremely offensive to advertise a facility that almost does not exist. They have an utterly ridiculous and silly method for wifi authentication which makes it extremely inconvenient to use it.

Furniture is trashy and there are lot for cockroaches in toilet. Nice hotel to stay : The hotel location is the best point about this hotel, breakfast was excellent, room was nice as well. Stay at Mountain courtyard : We stayed for one night and view from forest flame is awesome. Room size is too good and balcony size and coffee table which excited me most. Just one concern, food quality is average and prices are too high. Very good : Nice stay. Nice atmosphere. Very good food. Very good room services. The experience : The hotel ambience coupled with the view of the Misty Mountain is the most attractive and catchy thing. Really fitting to the name of the hotel. Misty Mountain, total justice to the name. Tasty food and very hospitable staff : North indian food is very tasty in this hotel. Very hospitable staff, specially the manager Mr. Chandrashekhar. One poor thing about this hotel is that it doesn't have a bell and every time for room service the person keeps knocking the door. Massage service set up is terrible. However location of the hotel is very ideal. View is excellent. Camp fire on terrace is good. Great location and great accessibility : Had a great stay at Misty Mountains. Great views from rooftop and secret garden. We a group of 5 taken 2 rooms and given a kinda suite for 3 of a family a single room for a couple. Food is good and sufficient varieties. But fiery spicy (Hot) for us. But normal by kerala standard. Recommend this place for a good decent hygienic stay. Worth for each penny : We started there for one day. The room and secret garden for fabulous. The room which we book was valley view room. The view was great from your balcony. Night dinner buffet was awesome.

If booking here ensure you book for room with view. It's the best. They have a nice garden too. Don't book inside Munnar too dirty too crowded, book here and then visit Munnar. Well maintained hotel : If you want to enjoy the nature and rare sounds of birds please wake up before sunrise and just go to the hotels roof located at 6th floor. Nice stay with a great view and location : I traveled with my wife. Selected this place by seeing alot good reviews and it was a good decision. Main attraction is the location. 'valley view' rooms give a nice view from the room, its worth the extra penny you spent. Complimentary breakfast and dinner buffet was also great. I. Preferred buffet dinner (some amount/person) compared to. Ala carte. Average : Staffs were cordial. Ambiance was good. Room cleanliness was satisfactory. But bathroom was congested. Food was not good and all the dishes were not available till the end. Superb view of Munnar tea gardens, Sengulam dam and valley and convenient location : Stayed at Misty Mountain during Feb 2020. Overall a wonderful experience. Hotel location is perfect, from the valley view room we could enjoy the fabulous view of the valley, Sengulam dam and tea gardens. The restaurant and food was amazing. Could make it better with some South Indian starters. The bed and bathroom need some improvement, especially the bath could be split to a dry bath area outside the shower. By and large, a wonderful hotel experience and we highly recommend this place. While room facing the front is good the rear rooms are darker and feel like no energy : The reception staff are not professionally capable of handling the front desk Excellent stay : Extraordinary hotel at nice location with good hospitality. Star quality at cheaper rates. Valley view rooms are highlight. Average Stay : Many Resort activities were absent. No music in the camp fire, secret garden was always locked. Karaoke was absent. Gym was not functional. Cheaper option : Location is good, room provided was facing a back wall, asked for a change and offered one. Average stay : Hotel is good in all ways but not worth in this price range. Good vacation : Clean room, good food, helping staff. Awesome valley view : We will definitely enjoy the valley view rooms. Which gives a wide view of valley tea plantations etc. Good hotel at excellent location : Awesome breakfast, window view inside room is the main attraction, staff behavior very polite, service is good, their top floor is attached to a garden standing on a hill top where you can have good photographs and an excellent view with rich ambience. Good enough Resort : Everything was fine and the garden is also good. Clean and the location is comfortable to visit all the places near Munnar.

Definitely will return to stay here when I return to Munnar. Good Stay : No swimming pool. Rooms are a bit small, base rooms does not have ac. The view outside window is almost blocked for the basic rooms. View is good for Valley sight rooms. The view from the terrace is awesome.

Excellent Stay : Stayed for 2 days, the food is very good and the room service is excellent. The room is very good and toilet very clean. The view from our valley side room was more beautiful than expected in this budget. I just loved the ambiance : Behavior of staff was excellent. Total friendly atmosphere. Good place, awesome view, value for money : Amazing hotel, location is perfect, you wake up in morning with sunrise and a tea plantation view (if your room is on the view facing Side). Good at restaurant was very good. Location is good : Property is good but need to improve of food Good stay but issue with payment : Super deluxe room quality is good but no view. Only front Side room has excellent view. Room size and facilities are good. Breakfast variety I and quality is good. They dont know how to prepare chinese/North Indian dish. Body massage service was good. But the biggest issue is about the payment for food and other additional services. They did not accept credit or debit card. There is a option for UPI payment but it is not working. So you have to pay cash at the time of check out. This is not accepted for such a good hotel. Solo travelers : The hotel is on the best location, amazing sunrise and sunset I've enjoyed both beautiful views. Misty may be, but not a Resort! : A good place with an excellent scenic view, provided you get a room with a view! Very good location. Good breakfast spread. Overall very good but not a Resort, as named. Yes, they put on a bonfire on the terrace at night. Location : Bit old resort, 8 km from city centre, but good location. Hotel review : Cozy abode Amazing food Courteous staff Highly recommended Not a pleasant stay : This place has great reviews but doesn't live up to it. The only good thing is its view as it right next to valley point. Otherwise there rooms aren't clean infect the kettle was stinking horribly. Overall we didn't enjoy staying at the hotel and were happy to leave. Good : Hotel with cleanliness, natural beauty, good food and parking, garden, trekking. Stay was good : It's good place to stay. But the only problem is that it was far away from the Munnar City.

All property and accommodation are four star but rooms like 2. 5-star hotel. Good location : Location is very good, co operative staff All is well : Excellent in Pullivasal area. Awesome location : Please select rooms with a hill view. A good experience of stay and location : There was initial hiccups in check in as there the room offers was not comfortable for family of four as promised/shown in MMT booking.

Excellent stay : Nice location, excellent quality food, staff behavior nice, and excellent. Over all pleasant stay. Awesome, just awesome : This hotel is at a very great location. You can see tea farms when you look out of your window. Room are spacious, clean and have almost all facilities. Staffs are good and mannered. I liked the breakfast as it had variety of items. PS: View from the hotel is amazing. Average Stay : Stay was good but had problems and hot water few times otherwise room and view was good. Food taste was not good and the menu was extremely poor.

They were eager to help. Food was just awesome and price are also less compare to other resorts. Breakfast was also awesome because it was mixture of North Indian and South Indian dishes. Every dish was fantastic. Resort maintain the greenery very well. It is six kilometer away from city so you need transport to hang around in the Munnar. If you want to go with jeep safari they also provide that. I also did spa that was also good. The best thing of the resort was morning walk with Philips. It was really great experience. He will tell you about the spices and different kind of trees available in the city. It is really helpful for school going kids so if you are planning to stay in Munnar so try to make one morning walk with Philip. He will take you the tea garden and show you different spices on the way. He has great knowledge of plant and he also know the history of trees. Cons: If you are planing to go with small kid then there are stairs in some rooms. It up to you. Thank you Munnar Tea Country Resort for making our stay fabulous. Stay is good but no much activity available in the resort : Spa quality is not that good but price is cheaper. They could have added few more process in ayurvedic massage than it will be more effective. Food quality is good but taste is not up to the mark. A stay really enjoyed : A very enjoyable stay.

Old lady like me had to climb the stairs not only to the room but also inside the room as the bedroom was up and the washroom was down. Inspite of complaining hot water was not available. Inspite of asking the reception to book an auto for me quickly they took their own sweet time and the auto driver also took about 15 minutes to land. In all a very bad experience. Sorry. We \",\n",

The staff made sure that we reach there correctly by informing us of the exact location by contacting us beforehand. The check-in process is very hassle free.

The rooms are well kept and neatly managed. The surroundings are well cleaned and filled with beautiful flowers and perfect for your photos and selfies. The restaurant is worth mentioning. Even though the prices are a little bit high, the quality of service and the qunatity of food you're having is very high. Even the free breakfast is a great feast with multiple varieties of buffet-style foods varying from local puttu and puri to western pancakes and maple syrup.

The staff at the hotel is superb, they make feel like home and great hospitality. The Restaurent is having excellent food quality and service with lot of options for vegetarians as well. The view from the balcony was awesome you could see the entire valley and the restaurant also had a panoramic views. Overall experience was excellent and a must recommend for the people visiting Munnar. Only difficulty is that you should have a hired vehicle or own vehicle with you since the cab service offered by the hotel is on a bit costlier Side. But it is worth visiting the place and even if you have to shell extra bucks for the taxi do it. Nice one : The hotel service is good. The food is also good. The ambience and the rooms are very comfy and clean. The staff is very helpful and soft spoken. The morning Tea plantation visit was a nice experience. The tour guide for it was also good.

They took care of everything starting from check in to check out. Staff is exceptional in service. Awesome location with breath taking view. Food is good. Rooms are clean. Well located : I was on an official trip to Adoor. Unexpectedly this hotel maintains cleanliness and four star status despite being in a suburban region. Well located in the town, it is easy to reach. Rooms are spacious, clean neatly maintained. Looks like a recent refurbishing has happened. The staff are friendly, the reception is a bit slow though, especially checking in. The only downside which I could remember is the restaurant (this is my third stay in the same hotel). If there are not enough guests, buffet breakfast won’t be there and a la Carte might take long time. Overall pleasant experience. It's not a 4 star : Average rooms average food and cheap tricks to charge more money. We were asked for extra for peak season even after paying for 3 nights. Thanks, make my trip we got that refunded but hotel people were unprofessional and wasted a lot of our time. Only money is what they want : The name of hotel is chosen to confuse people. Don't mistaken it with Tea County of KTDC. The place so congested and the location not good. Its is not value for money and be careful while booking.

Everything about this place is simply wow. Highly recommended. Excellent property with super staff service : I would like to compliment for the staff service, they were mind blowing and will never disappoint foe anything. Property is very good. Only problem I faced little far away from Munnar Town so, everyday you will have to cover that extra 15 kms. Rest all perfect. Munnar : Far off location from the Town center Stay quality : The resort is beautiful and peaceful. Good service, good rooms and amidst nature's tranquility. Food can be improved! Excellent stay : Special thanks to Mr. Matthew for being always available. Lunch and dinner was bad for us : Average hotel, breakfast seems good. Lunch and dinner which was not included in our plan (but we ordered from there itself) was too bad and too costly. Great family vacation : The stay was great at Tea Country Resort. The staff were great and courteous. Will recommend the place to everyone. Munnar Valley View : The hotel is best place to stay as couple and for kids. The warmth and courtesy of staff is superb. The food menu is healthy and valley view point bis just excellent. A gym facility would be an if added will be Kohinoor in the crown. I would recommend the hotel. Amazing value for money stay : Stayed 3 nights here and had one of the most amazing experiences. The resort is located at a great place and the scenic beauty adds to the charm. The breakfast is great, service is very good. Room service is excellent with staff available within 5 mins of placing a request. Best part is that they enquire about you taking your lunch/dinner by calling and enquiring which shows the level of service quality and concern. Staff is great and very friendly. Don't miss the trek from Philip if you are staying here which comes complimentary. Strong recommend for Munnar. Excellent Stay : What a fantastic Resort. Such a great experience.

Everything we ordered was perfect, and customized as per our requirements when we wanted. We were constantly prompted for service levels, and treated with great care. Even after we left the manager texted to check if we reached our next destination safely and asked for things they could do better. I stayed at a 5 star hotel after this but the standards set by this place made the 5 star look worse than a 3 star. This place rocks. Excellent room with separate hall and dining table : Wonderful experience. Clean rooms with separate hall and dining space, down to earth staffs, good food, excellent atmosphere, Awesome Resort : It was a amazing experience, room and resort cleaned and very well. I stayed honeymoon villa its outside view marvelous, breathtaking view, good staff. MTCR is a complete nature friendly resort. : All staffs are very nice and friendly. Room outside atmosphere is very awesome with greenery and different flowers. Excellent Stay : Stay was excellent. Spacious rooms and good ambience. Average Stay : Overall service is average. Not equivalent to 4 star. Awesome and pleasure giving : The resort is in a beautiful place surrounded by mountain. Staff was so friendly and co-operative, food was good. Especially breakfast having so many options from healthy to tummy filled foods. And the best part was I booked a Valley view villa but they upgrade us in a family cottage the scenic beauty from the room balcony is beautiful. Overall the stay was romantic relaxing and memorable. Over the cloud : I had a very pleasant stay in MTCR, the staff is very co-operative, understands and helps in getting our things done. Breakfast and dinners were tasty, the location of the resort was too good, we liked the 1bhk concept, bedroom on the first floor and a big living room on the ground floor. It's perfect for family vacations. Recommend all to experience MTCR hospitality. Excellent for couple stay. : I stayed here for two nights. The ambiance and rooms were excellent. The staff was too good. I recommend this hotel for a pleasant stay. Awesome stay : It is really awesome experience in MTC Resort. The view from honeymoon villa is really excellent.

Excellent stay. : This property is very well maintained, courteous staff, tasty and wide variety of food they upgraded our stay from horizon view to Valley view type. The ground floor is sitting area, Kitchenette and dining area while upstairs is just bed room and terrace. Feels just at home. Only shortcoming is the resorts 's entrance pathway from main road. You will need a cab at your disposal. Service and location. : Service, staff, food, location, spa all are very good and value for money. Good property with luxurious villas and warm staff. : We stayed at Munnar Tea Country Resort for 3 nights in late August. Below is review of the same. Getting there: We self drove from Kochi to Munnar. The drive took almost 4 hours. \",\n",
       "  \"Roads were good, barring 1-2 places. Reg Resort, Google maps mislead us so it is better to call Resort for directions once you get closer to place. Rooms: We stayed at Valley view room. The room was really spacious with ground floor for sitting and dining and bedroom upstairs. Reg Valley view, we had a partial view of the Valley as view is obscured by trees. There is a viewing deck just outside room which provides a panoramic view of the entire Valley. Otherwise room was comfortable. Food: Food is served at a restaurant which offers panoramic views of the Valley! Food served is homely, tasty and economical. We thoroughly enjoyed Kerala cuisines especially during breakfast and North Indian dishes were also tasty and well made. Service and people: Special mention to entire staff. Staff is very warm, helpful and attentive. They go extra mile to ensure your needs are satisfied. Outstanding service. Overall thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend this Resort. P.S. Do take the trek with Phillip. It is a refreshing walk through tea plantation and Phillip will take you through various flora of the area and give you a short history of Munnar. Cosy villa's at great location : Everything is neat and clean. Well maintained even in this off season. A small guided trekking available for free of cost. Half day and full-day trekking options are also available. Over all a nice experience. Excellent Stay : Amazing stay. The location is very good. The view from the balcony is just awesome. Would to everyone! Excellent stay : The place has good view points and the rooms are good. Food was very tasty. Excellent Stay : We stayed on 09 and 10 Aug 2019. Excellent property with wonderful and hospitable staff. View from the rooms and restaurant is awesome. Hugely recommended for anybody looking for good property close to Munnar. Awesome facilities : A must visit place for family, hotel staff take cares of your needs. Their buffet breakfast is very good, they organize trekking for visitors at Tea garden with experience guide. Courteous staff, tasty Kerala food and overlooking Hills! : Rooms were cleanly and well behaved staffs. But the room was little smaller than I expected or what I seen in the sites. There was nothing special about honeymoon villa's, or least I didn't feel anything special about it. You'll have a fantastic view of overlooking Hills. Don't expect an entertainment activities here. Service good : Everything is good and ambience was also good Stay with family : A decent average kind of hotel. Food was very good. Munnar Tea Country resorts : Resort Location The Resort is located in a hilly region which gives you a good view and a peaceful stay. The resort is quite well known by the cab drivers so no efforts required to reach there. Rating 4/5. Resort structure The way overall Resort is built is just amazing, I and my wife loved it. We had a Valley view villa room like a duplex having a hall, dining table, washroom, small kitchen with mini-refrigerator and coffee machine at ground floor. There are small stairs leading to your bedroom has a small balcony. Rating 4/5. Food Breakfast We had a free breakfast in our booking. They have buffet system for breakfast which has a wide range of options from Kerala idli, dosa etc to French toast, parathas, juice and many more. Rating 5/5. Lunch and dinner They don't have a wide range of options for the mains but the main dishes are very much available with them. Like Kerala, Punjabi, Chinese etc. Rating 3. 5/5. Ambience Just loved the overall ambience over there. Everything is maintained well by them, cleanliness is there. Rating 4/5. Service Room cleaning service is available only in the morning and not in the evening if required. Rest is all ok. Rating 4/5. Other services For sightseeing they have a predefined list which any cab driver follows and if you add any new location they'll charge anyhow. Cab facilities are costly in Munnar region. The resort does make cabs available for you on request. Overall 4/5. I would recommend visiting the Resort for its quality, ambience, structure, locality. Good Stay : Super friendly staffs. We did not even feel like we are in a hotel. Rooms was fantastic. Kids play area is also awesome. Nice stay, good service : This is 10 km far from Munnar. It's very cool and calm place.

Beautiful Resort : The Resort is located right from nature's own place, we had a warm and excellent welcome from the staffs of Resort, I would definitely recommend this Resort for nature lover and as well as the family get together. Food was also very nice, but only thing is that they should have any one variety of South indian dishes, because it's slightly difficult to find Sout\",\n",

Excellent place to stay : Pretty cottage type rooms with views of the Valley. Friendly staff with good service. Food is good. Had a very relaxing massage. Overall good place to stay. Only problem is finding the place. The Google map, though correct, does not show your location properly for some reason. The sign for turn is small, and not visible from opposite direction. (turn is opposite a big blue sign for marian Sea food). Steep access Road, climb in first gear. Best to call hotel for directions when you are near. Excellent : Nice Resort.

The property was not large but it was clean and very well-maintained, and we had an amazing stay there. One thing unique about this hotel is the rooms, where you get a 1 BHK house all to yourself with your own sitting area, dining table with chairs, a mini kitchen in the ground floor and bedroom in the first floor which promises space, security and total comfort. Breakfast spread was also very good. And to top it off, awesome service by the best staff that any hotel could have. The hotel provides a complimentary trek with Mr\",\n",
       "  \". Philip, a very friendly and knowledgeable guy who knows about every fauna and flora in the region through Hills and tree plantation, which was another highlight of the stay. We should definitely come back again. View, service of the staff, spaciousness, privacy, security all were awesome.

MTCR good for comfy stay : MTCR is all about warm hospitality and nice rooms. MTCR is all about their warm hospitality and nice rooms. Food was OK. View from common area was nice. Rooms don't provide a great view as expected. Don't have much of activities to do inside the property. Not much amble space in the property. I suggest MTCR for people visiting Munnar expecting a Weekend break with comfy stay. Excellent Stay : This was our first time visiting MTCR. The facility is lovely with beautiful duplex cottages. The staff were courteous, and we absolutely loved the customer service. We really enjoyed the nature walk with philip, in fact, walk through the tea plantations was really refreshing.

They serve delicious food and the view from their restaurant a panorama is beautiful. Apart from these, MTCR has kids play area, offers spa (Oceana), and arranges daily activities including camp fire and DJ. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay with MTCR and had a great time. We will visit again for sure. Fantastic people and service : Rooms are duplex, the toilets are on the ground floor and bedroom on 1st. So you have to move up down to visit loo at night.

I will suggest this hotel to families and couples who visit the place Unprofessional / Insensitive / Inhuman Management : My Review Heading says it all. Being a Head of a multinational company in India, I get an opportunity to travel extensively within India as well as abroad... & Thus have stayed in many kind of hotels in the process but possibly, this was one of my worst experience ever, purely on human considerations. I traveled to the hotel with my 87 years old father, with clear pre - intimation at the time of the booking that I will be travelling with my old father who can\\'t even walk properly but I bring him to Kerala, as he wanted to see this country of God\\'s (... As they call it) perhaps for the last time in his life. No one informed us at the time of booking that the room configuration was duplex type with beds on the upper level with wash room / toilet at the ground level. As this was realized only after reaching the hotel, we made a request for a change to alternate room which had sleep + washroom configuration on the ground floor itself. After having traveled for 6 hrs. From Kochi to have reached the hotel at 6pm, we were made to sit at the reception for another 2 hrs, despite the fact that my dad was not even able to hold himself to sit... & It was a literal torture on his body. After this 2 hrs of literal agony, despite an opportunity to give us the room with right structure, operational manager, Mr. Mathews was shockingly inhuman to demand a higher price. Despite involving GM of the hotel, Abbas, we could not find a solution even on the next day as a result compulsively has to make my 87 years old dad sleep alone on the ground floor on an extra bed. Despite the fact that Mr. Manu, possibly with some self realization of the situation, tried his level best to provide some comfort, but naturally considering totally unprofessional approach by the management, we spent 2 compulsive days at the hotel, as we had already paid the entire money in advance & hotel was not even willing to get us an accommodation in an alternate hotel. The hospitality and food quality : Excellent service, staff were very friendly and eager to help. The nature\\'s walk was akin to a private tour of the tea gardens. The view of the valley along with shifting mist covers is nothing short of heaven on earth .. The hotel supports the adage \" God\\'s own country\" Wonderful resort : Resort facility is up to the international standard. Right from room service team to chef all the staff in the resort was very courteous and helpful. Will definitely recommend this resort to everyone. Excellent service and stay : Good location. Very good service and very courteous staff. Had excellent time there. Rooms were very clean and the travel desk was also good in arranging the local tour. The morning trek through the tea estates with Mr. Philip was enjoyable. Location is very good : Nice hospitality was there, food was very good, and the location is perfect. The place is awesome and there are many activities which are organised in tea country resort. Those activities are good and we enjoy especially when we are with family ... The spa and massage facility is also there but it can be improved a bit. Hotel for a stay : We had good experience in staying in the hotel. Location was perfect to relax and hospitality was also good. Can add south indian food in the menu. The road leads to the hotel was steeply and difficult to locate in one go. The complimentary breakfast was also good to choose from variety. Location & Service is great : Location of this place is absolutely beautiful. The staff is very polite and include the gardeners. Room service is great. Food was great too. This place is situated some distance before actual Munnar so no tea gardens there, but the view was still nice. Extremely well maintained property. Designed to blend into the backdrop. Overall ',\n",
       "  \"extremely happy that I stayed there. My kids loved the fish and chips, they just ate that all the time. Great service : It was a fantastic stay, The Rooms were very good and clean and food was very tasteful. Perfect place for honeymoon. The welcome was very traditional. Overall the service of the staff was very friendly and courteous Beautiful property : We stayed for 2N/3D in March 2017 and booked via MMT. The property is beautiful although the view is less than spectacular. The service is absolutely great and the people made us feel at home at every turn. The food was uniformly good but the prices I felt were very high indeed given that the same items in Munnar town (7 kms away) were available much cheaper. The property was developed & sold as uniform one/two room studios to buyers initially WITH uniform interiors and is now being operated as a resort by the hospitality arm of the same developer. So you are greeted by a + bathroom - all very adequately turned out. The jarring note for me was the very loud shades of orange+yellow on the walls. Not exactly what you expect in the relaxing environ of hills and nature. But that's just me perhaps. And the drawing roof seating is VERY uncomfortable. No lumbar support and 90 degrees straight backed. I used it for stowing suitcases. The cane chairs out front were grand and the bed was very comfy. The external landscaping around the property is TOP NOTCH... Better than some 5 star properties I have been too. They have really built the aura of the property around this and it is absolutely fantastic. As a result of this beautiful flora & fauna, there are a lot of birds around the property which is so very lovely from early morn through the day. SO in summary, great property & fantastic people but they need to work a little harder on the value proposition. Awesome Location & Best Services : I booked valley view room and view from the room was awesome. Staff assistance was one of the best I experienced during my stay. Special thanks to Mr. Philip for spice plantation visit. Definitely I would like to stay @ Munnar Tea Country Resort whenever I vist Kerala. One of the best resorts in Munnar : One of the best resorts in Munnar to spend a peaceful vacation ... Situated in a beautiful locality among the green mountains. The ambience is at its best. The villa was pleasant and gives you a homely feeling. Friendly staff. Good food. The sunset view from the resort is beautiful. A must visit place with family and friends. Great service and care : The best part of the hotel is the care taken by staff for all the guests. Very nice views for the hotel and good landscape. The hotel is 9 km away from Munnar city and is good for leisure. Please don't confuse this the popular Munnar Tea County resort which is in Munnar City Lovely location in midst of the misty mountains : Very nicely maintained resort, lovely location clean and big duplex rooms, great staff organising activities, special thanks to Mr Philips for taking us on a wonderful morning trek, Ms Jaquiline made by day by dressing me in Kerala spree. Thank you so much Awesome experience, excellent : Probably the best resort to stay in at Munnar. We were greeted with a warm, traditional welcome including bindi pooja & garlands. A glass of fresh fruit juice was offered as welcome drink. The property is big and clean with very helpful staff so much so that we asked for an extra towel and were presented with two. Breakfast was included in the stay price and had many options along with local specialities cooked to order. The view from the diner and rest of the resort is breathtaking. Did I mention that all of their rooms are duplexes! The staff arranges various complementary events like a walking tour of tea and spice garden two times a day for their guests, camp fire in the evenings with some great songs playing in the background and badminton tournaments. No complaints whatsoever. The only place I would stay at whenever I visit Munnar again. Must visit resort in Munnar : This is the best resort to visit. Specially for couples it's really superb place to visit. They arrange beautiful candle light dinner as per your requirements. Staff is very friendly and caring. Location can't be better than this. Valley view premium cottage is the best choice we have made. Please do visit this place without second thought. Must visit. Good resort to go with family : Overall a good location. Peaceful place to spend time with family but a little poor in service More over no it's far away from the Munnar town any thing we should get needed earlier from the Munnar only. Awesome stay : We a group of five friends stayed at Munnar Tea Country Resort on the 28th & 29th of August 2016. Location of the resort is one of the best early morn\",\n",
       "  \"ing the resort was covered with mist and we had a personalised breakfast served by the ever smiling Shaji Augustine. We had a karaoke night at the resort & the staff (especially Manoj and Manu) were always there for us & made our stay very comfortable and memorable. Our next stay at this resort will be in 2018 when Neelakurunji flowers will bloom (Neelakurunji a flower which blooms once in twelve years). Keep up the good work team & hope you will maintain the resort very well. Excellent personalised service : We stayed at Munnar Tea Country Resort on 28th & 29th August. Although the approach to the resort is not very good team Manu, Manoj and Shaji were very hospitable. Good rooms and awesome view from the resort. Great service/people but mediocre property/food : People here were very warm and overall service was great. One of the best hospitality I've ever received. But on the flip side the property is very average. Food was not that great. Never even think of going during peak season, especially diwali. It's filled with people everywhere. The property is very small and everywhere you go you see people, no single place to have peace! Go on a small hike around tea gardens. Make sure you go with Philip. He was one of the nicest guys! Good place to stay : The resort effortlessly blends with picturesque scenery of Munnar. The hotel is located in a very well landscaped piece of land, often covered by mild mist. The view for the resort is what you pay for. The rooms are well appointed, but the same cannot be said about bathroom. The bathroom looked faded and the bathroom fixtures seemed to be used beyond its lifespan. The restaurant serves some delicious dishes for a very reasonable price. It is quite advantageous for Muslim guests as the restaurant serves halal food. I felt the resort lacked behind in housekeeping. Not a deal breaker as the specular view makes up for it. Excellent Stay : Wonderful location, excellent food, rooms and other amenities. What makes it even beautiful place to stay is its people. Excellent hospitality!!! Staff is always smiling and happy to help. Villas are beautiful by interior and makes you feels like a home away home. Clean room and excellent breakfast : Very nice location, cleaner rooms with comfortable of nice view from the room. Reception staff are very nice and explained how to utilize their facility and tour around the places. Restaurant served Vegetarian and Non Vegetarian varieties in their menu. Live cooking for the breakfast is an excellent idea, which our children enjoyed placing orders and getting what they preferred to have in the breakfast. Excellent...!! : Access road needs improvement as its damaged, too steep and scary. Poor Stay : The overall experience was not good. The bath area was dirty and room service was not good. We found insect in the morning breakfast showed the same to the service manager but neither anybody got back nor anyone was apologetic. Excellent Stay : I stayed there for couple of days and was amazed by hospitality. Staff were extremely supportive. Room was very spacious. Food was very good. They arranged food even when restaurant was closed. Room service were extremely good and proactive. We didn't had to call them to clean the room they came in the morning. Nice and pleasant stay : Nice and Pleasant stay - extremely helpful and caring staff - rooms are a tad bit small but the view is outstanding ( stayed in Room 301 ). Breakfast is one area which needs improvement - same menu every day. We travelled with a infant and 2 senior citizens - the staff went extra mile to ensure everyone was well taken care of. The staff were very friendly and helpful : We had a very nice stay at and the staff were very friendly and helpful. The food was good and the service was excellent. We would definitely recommend this place to anyone travelling to Munnar. They had Bonfire and get together too which was enjoyed by the young people. Great stay & great view : Had an excellent trip to Munnar and a great stay at Munnar Tea Country Resort. The resort is situated on the hillside overlooking a valley. The view from the room was great. The staff there were courteous and the overall, service is good. They are also arranging visits to nearby tourist attractions. Excellent resort to stay : Excellent resort and staff especially front office. Cleanliness, ambiance, food and the service are excellent. Keep the good job Tea Country. It's a good place to relax with your dear ones. Best place for newly married couples : I have visited Munnar and booked tea country hotel for my honeymoon trip. It was a excellent experience. Hotel services, location and rooms, food are excellent and I always prefer to stay in this hotel. Thank you makemytrip for this fantastic exp\"],\n",
       " [\"Rivelute, Munnar : Location was extremely good. Variety and good quality of food. All staff was polite, cooperative and always ready. Excellent Stay : All things are perfect like food stay and service. Loved it! : The Resort is located next to a River and probably the best time to stay there is during monsoons or post monsoons. However we visited in february end and still loved it because of the hospitality of the people there. We got a free upgrade to a villa and it was very beautiful. The Resort has a few activities but nothing extraordinary. Has a spa where you can get some ayurvedic massages. The staff were very courteous and made us feel at home. We thought the food wasn't that great and a little over priced. Good stay, great location : Location and staff of the hotel were excellent, only thing missing was a swimming pool. Free upgrade to premium suite : We booked a royal suite, but we got free upgrade to premium one. Rooms have nice view of River. You will enjoy birds singing in the morning. You might spot few in your balcony. There are other activities in the hotel. It is a big property, you will definitely enjoy your stay.  : Best Resort at best prices. Treks n River is main attraction. Hotel provides many leisure activities. Kids will have fun there Peaceful and serene location : Rivulet Resort is a wonderful place to stay in Munnar. Away from city hustle bustle near river. Best place for couples. Good services. Rivulet Resort and Munnar : It was a three days trip and the experiences are awesome. It will definitely fulfill the thirst of a tour lover. The tour is incomplete without staying at the Rivulet Resort.

Near Munnar. Amazing place to spend quality time with your loved ones : Amazing place to spend quality time with your loved ones Good resort with serene surrounding : Most rooms have river view. Royal suite is spacious and clean. My room was very close to the river and had great view. But was little away from restaurant which included climbing few stairs. But that was not much issue for me and my family. Food could have been better. Many items in breakfast and dinner buffer were not warm enough. The spread included the usual stuff. It would have been better if there was something there to make it special. One more point on location. This resort is about 14 kms from Munnar and at lower altitude. So not as much cooler to give a proper hill station feel. Too far from the City : This hotel is best if you are here for peace because the City is too far from here and u cannot go outside deluxe rooms was average Great stay, great food, nice hotel : Nice hotel for a family, spacious rooms, great food. Enjoyed the short stay here Food : Food options in buffet was very few, other than that everything was great. Must stay in Rivulet. Excellent view : It's a pleasant stay with a good view but food quality is terrible. Worthy stay : Pleasant stay, staff was very kind. Excellent Stay : It's awesome for me. Paradise in Munnar : It is the place to be in Munnar. The location and set up is the best. Food is tasty for short stay(otherwise some food will repeat). Found the spa a bit unhygienic as I could smell oil all around but is bearable. The staff is extremely well-trained and courteous. Will visit again and hope spa services improve next time. Beautiful stay : Overall pleasant stay with my family. Rivulet experience : It was good but it would have been better if there were more of holiday activities, other indoor games, and adventure games as they could make our stay in this \",\n",
       "  \"hotel a fascinating one. Being a holiday resort unlike the other commercial and luxury resorts this is what guests expect.

This is definitely the best among the best in Munnar Its mind blowing and wonderful : The staff behaviour is very good. Service is very quick and satisfactory. The rooms are specious and clean.

Excellent Stay : View is excellent and good service Nice location : Very good property away from buzzle and busy roads. Nice atmosphere for relaxation. Stay at Munnar : The Resort is very good and location and ambience was very nice. Good and service also very good. I recommend this Resort to visit once again. Activity seems to be very less as a Resort. Worst hotel in Munnar : Don't stay in this hotel. Fraud hotel Very high price as compared to facilities provided. Didn't gave cottage also and shown picture of cottage Excellent : Hotel location was amazing, near to the running water, at the bottom of the Valley. Cool breeze at night feels so refreshing. The service is very good at hotel, the staff is very welcoming. In food there are very less option for veg, there should be more.

Large rooms and total facilities are good Good : Overall good. Foof quality requires significant improvement. Awesome scenic villas : We stayed there for couple of nights in tamarind villa. View from balcony was just heavenly due to River facing along with mountains, you wake up with bird chirping in the morning, while standing in balcony can literally feel the fresh air during inhaling if you are coming from a City. Very courteous and helpful staff, prompt in service. Cycling for a short time was good experience over there. If you have good budget then select villas only, food was above average but considering the other amenities and scenic views, you will be content in the end overall. Very good view from the villa. Rivulet fa\",\n",
       "  \"bulous experience : Eco friendly environment, nice river view, good service and friendly staffs. Neat and clean room as well as the resort premises and peaceful location. The only thing I didn't like is the road towards the resort, lots of potholes which can make you upset while driving. Review : Nice resort. Worth for money. Like to visit again. Good hotel, clean and well maintained cottages : Would recommend for families. Amazing place, very well maintained cottages, though expensive, food was good. Staffs were good too. Not to be repeated : Lack of service and major communication gap between the management and staff. Good Stay : Restaurant is very expensive and they don't have buffet dinner system and breakfast options is very minimum. Room was good but hotel is cut off the road and breakfast is minimum options there. Excellent : Location is fantastic. Sounds of the water was amazing. Staff is very well trained. It was good experience. Shower partition would have helped. One night in rivulet : Amazing stay. Suite rooms are best. Location is just superb. Have coffee with river. In night sleep with sound of water. Dinner was good. Breakfast needs improvement with some more dishes. Good Stay : Just want to say it is a nice property. Everything was fine we liked the stay view was nice. Good Stay : Excellent stay, friendly staff. Enjoyed my stay. Recommend to family stay. Great rooms with beautiful view. : The rooms are big and clean. The location is far from Munnar town but the best you can get. The birds chirping, flowing river view was just awesome. The food and staff are good. Excellent stay : Really nice villas adjacent to a flowing river makes this destination a must try. Amazing river/waterfall view from balcony. Good view, good cottage : Only the prices are little high otherwise everything was perfect. Munnar : Great staff and superb service. Superb stay and enjoyed a lot. Best stay in Munnar : It may look long from Munnar. but it's worth to go that long. amenities which they have was awesome. One of the best Resort which I have seen. Nice view with river outside. Excellent location, excellent nature view : Excellent location close to Pallivasal Hydel Project of KSEB. Excellent hotel : Hotel located in easy accessible distance and rooms are really excellent. Stay at Rivulet : Great rooms with a beautiful view of the river. Cut away from the hustle bustle, we had a peaceful and relaxed 2 day stay. Could hear the birds chirping throughout and we enjoyed taking a stroll around the property. Staff was efficient and helpful. Food was good and we managed to get vegetarian options. We also enjoyed the Ayurvedic spa at the resort. We tried our hand at archery with the help of Mr. Shihab. He was very patient and encouraging and we actually managed to get some good shots. Would definitely love to visit again in future. Complete awesome : Location, food, management and service everything is awesome. Great stay : The stay was great. We had gone there to celebrate our dad's birthday. The room had a great view. Every room in that resort had a great view of the river. The continuous sound of the water flowing was soothing. The breakfast was OK. Rooms and bathroom were well maintained and the resort staffs were friendly and helpful. Would recommend this resort to anyone visiting Munnar. The only turn off was the distance from Munnar City around 15-18 km An excellent place to relax : Everything is excellent in Rivulet. I really loved the location. Food seems to be bit expensive but quality is good. We whole family enjoyed the 2 night and 3 days stay there. cottage, sceneries : Resort is at a prime location, views from cottage are awesome. Very beautiful cottage. Nice peaceful stay. Very good food but price can be reduced. Overall stay was really nice. Loved the stay : We had an awesome time at The Rivulet. The rooms have one of the best view that I have experienced. You can see the river flowing and misty mountains lying in the bed which is a sheer bliss. The staff is very friendly, helpful and always smiling. The pictures on MakeMyTrip and their website definitely do not do the justice to the real beauty of the place. The only disappointment was the breakfast which should be imp\",\n",
       "  \"roved. The staff were very friendly. Good : Far away from Munnar and climate is totally different from Munnar. Food is average. Activities are less. Trekking was awesome. Over priced. Food quality was good : They was good on there part. Food quality was good but on last night they did not served food properly, as their kitchen closed at 9 PM. Poor room service. There was very late in serving food. Best in Munnar : Amazing location. We enjoyed a lot in river view room and food quality was also good. An experience to remember : The location of this resort is breathtakingly beautiful, the staff was courteous and very friendly, food can be better, but it is a must experience property. Nice ambiance : River sound and cuckoo sounds are amazing, can improve spa services they have noisy spa rooms. Good Stay : Wrong direction was provided by the employee. Hence we lost our way in the night. Serene location : The hotel is far from Munnar but the traffic you feel in Munnar it is good to be away from the crowd. The location of the hotel is on the bank of a river and every room is facing the river. The other side of the river is full of green. That view will take your breath. The rooms are clean and the staff is extremely helpful and courteous. Food is good and you have both options, buffet and a la carte. Overall a very satisfying stay. Great place, value for money. Good food : It was really great experience o stay in Rivulet, nice location and good staff, Mr Shijo from front office gave us valuable suggestions to make the trip really memorable, warm welcome and good rooms. Good place to visit with family and friends. Nice resort. Good resort but that can do better . : Good rooms with nice views. The climate is not too cold (hot days during our stay April 9-13) as the property is about 12-13 kms below Munnar town which restricted the time spend outdoors@ the resort. There were A/cs in the rooms which offset the warmer mornings. Ambience and facilities at the resort were very good. Kids park, badminton courts, trekking paths and archery were good and relaxing. It was a most serene & peaceful stay. Kids had a good time at the park and archery while the trek through the property was quite good. On the flip side, the river is inaccessible and seems polluted too. Ayurvedic Spa was not worth the money spend, especially for people used to better treatments and services locally which are much cheaper too. Food was decent but not great with pretty set menu for breakfast. Variety in food would have been better or an even more local cuisine would have been preferable. . Overall, this was a pretty good stay which can get a lot better too. Unbeatable location and co-operative staff! : Unbeatable location !. The pics are so true to the actual experience and beauty. Lot of space within the resort to walk, walk along the river (river flow subjected to season and dam above), small tea gardens, small river bridge, seating next to river (bon-fire place), view from rooms- all fascinating. You could walk up to the Moselberg resort in the morning, have tea there for a change, if you go further till the temple then the walk is really satisfying. Must mention Mr. Shahib who is the guide for 8. 30am trek into the huge plantations behind the resort- his knowledge about the fauna and his zeal to engage the audience made the trek worth it and quite a different experience . Very co-operative staff for whatever you ask- adhoc request for bon-fire, archery. We also requested for ripe papaya hanging from the plants in the resort- with no hiccups, it was plugged, wrapped and given :) delicious organic stuff and great show of kindness !. Only negative I felt and experienced was food quality. Taste was good but might be stale. But this shouldn't be a deterrent as didn't see this specific review by others. Almost all in my family faced some extent of bad stomach, so we had to eat out for one-two meals. There is one fantastic veg restaurant in downtown Munnar, everyone would know. Couple of average restaurants in the market near to resort. Nice hotel and location. Friendly staff : Nice hotel and friendly staff and good location. Food should have more variety. Loved overall. Its good for relaxed stay. Overall value fo\",\n",
       "  'r money. The orchards were good and dam flowing was nice to view Decent place with okay kind : Didn\\'t match to the expectation and service was not stratifying. Food was just okay A beautiful view right from the room! : THis is an excellent hotel in a very good location. Ideal for couples who want to live a little out of the way from the town center. We had a view of the river flowing right in front of the room as advertised in the photos. The food is good though they could add more local delicacies. Not many restaurants near by but the place is meant for people who want more isolated and relaxed atmosphere. Good resort with courteous staff : Spacious, neat, clean rooms with a excellent view of a rivulet from balcony. Activities like spice plantation walk, Archery, Bamboo rafting, Games etc are provided by the resort. Staff is very helpful especially Mr. Shihab who teaches archery very well and also guides spice plantation walk. Just the location of resort is away from main area, so you need your own vehicle. In all a good place to relax & enjoy nature Resort location good : Experience was good. Resort was well maintained near the water stream. Getting there from Munnar is quite challenging since roadway is not that good. Should have been improved in the activities in the resort. We got bit bored in the resort. Complimentary breakfast was very bad. Excellent location, great welcome, super food, pleasant staff, all : Fantastic experience. Love the location. Great staff. Food very good. Staff are polite Nice ambience : Nice river view from villas . Rooms was good and clean. Staff are very supportive but services was little bit delay . . For the honeymoon suite decoration was not much expected. Bed decoration was good and the room decoration was poor. Average experience as no water flow in river : Overall decent property. However, key attraction is the river which has water flow primarily from July to September months only. If you are booking for any other period, please ask hotel for actual / current photos of the river before booking. During our stay, we also got a constant buzzing sound from the nearby power house. Rivulet : Good location. With clean amenities, restaurant menu is limited. Buffet is fine but can expect more spread of varieties! Very good ambience. Good service. : The welcome was great and the stay was amazing. The best time to visit Munnar is during the winter. Rivulet is the a good option for family with kids as there is a good landscape for the kids to have fun as well. Good resort to stay with family .. Nice view : Good view from balcony, right beside the lake .. Early morning bird sounds, you will have nice sleep, fantastic ambience, break fast was nice, you will have trekking option from morning 8am .. Nice garden for children\\'s to play around .. Location has few tea plantations near by you can have pictures .. The river by the hotel side : The room, breakfast and the facility provided by the hotel was amazing the only downside that I experienced was the location which is very far from the main city altogether it\\'s a value for your money The morning scenary is beauitful : The background of the room is priceless. It is situated in calm & less noisy area. Definitely people would fall in love with this place. The garden area located bear the river just relaxed your mind & soul by seeing it. Planning to visit soon with my family. Good hotel with value for money : Good rooms, and away from Munnar. Has nice views and good staff. Has a nice river view, and garden. Food is priced on the higher side. We had to pay 890 for a veg sandwich, chicken sandwich and two cups of tea. I understand room service is 20%, and we ordered as we had just reached from Bangalore. The price of the food is too much and the management should consider reducing it. The spa service are OK, and not value for the money you pay. The rooms were really clean and spacious. We stayed in the villa, with a living room and the rooms are worth the price you pay. Clean and spacious room but too far : We kept \"do not disturb\" but still housekeeping person pressed the doorbell and without our permission within 5 sec he entered the room. Coming to the restaurant we got paper in rice and we informe',\n",
       "  \"d restaurant person but he didn't even react to that. Resort is too inside. The usual route is closed but there is no board to direct the correct route. But it is beautiful. There is no such activities. It is not worth paying so much. Rooms are spacious and clean. Overall okay : The location is very good but a little faraway from tourist spots. The service wasn't good at all .. No restaurants nearby .. Just have to rely on the hotel restaurant .. Which does not have much options for vegetarian food and a little overpriced too I shd again mention the service was not good at all. Most of the guests were from Arab countries and the staff was busy to please them only ... Nice Stay !!! : The view and location is so nice. Could be better if rainfall is good. Overall pleasant stay. Food cost is too high. Located a little far off from main Munnar town and all sightseeing points. Decent value for money. This resort located in valley like location is very good for getting away from city life and enjoying peaceful holidays. Rooms and amenities are quite good. Average stay : Okay location. Okay rooms. Nice park for kids is also available with several swings and slides. Good people. Below average restaurant - good taste but not good spread. Located a little far off from main Munnar town and all sightseeing points. Decent value for money. Not worth the money, please don't go for it : Please opt for better hotels with the price you are paying for this one. There are many more hotels in Munnar with a much better view, like Misty Mountains, Club Mahindra, Plum Judy, The Fog.. We only went by the pics and online reviews and decided to go for this one, even though it had no discount. We were very disappointed with the location, because it is located in a valley, you cannot see the mountains and tea gardens. There toiletries were damn useless. They had bottles with 'Rivulet' scratched out, looked like they keep refilling the same bottle. They offer nature walk between 8:00-9:30 in the morning, which means you will have to stay hungry till then (breakfast starts at 8:00). Service was slow, overall not worth spending so much money. Again, I would say, please choose better hotels which can offer you a good view. Rivulet is an awesme stay : Honeymoon suite was booked for three days from MMT app, which gave me much money monetary benefits including complimentary breakfast. The only thing I fould bit bitter was the attitude of security people towards me, even though I paid almost a quarter lakh rupee to their resort. Spacious and clean rooms : We stayed in the resort for 2 days and the entire stay was pleasant and all the staff were courteous, and even the chef came out of his way in helping us in deciding places to visit. The room was spacious and neatly maintained and I would say it is really worth for each rupee spent. Beautiful location, great view : This resort located in valley like location is very good for getting away from city life and enjoying peaceful holidays. Rooms and amenities are quite good. Though the service is bit slow, but generally does not affect much. There is good tree covered area around to just take a walk. Definitely recommended for a quite peaceful holiday experience. Cosy comfortable stay .. Very : Room was good, I was on 7th floor ... Location a little let down ... Busy streets all aroundwith traffic crossings .. Good security systems ... Have a decent parking ... Room service reasonably quick .. But the hotel is fairly near to the city attractions Base of hill . . Away from proper Munnar. Beautiful. : Reception ... Good beautiful .. Staff .. Welll be heaved helpful .. Rooms are clean. Room service good but expensive. Morning is very much pleasant. Other services are nice but lack of indoor games except carrom. Only one problem viewable places are too far. Best stay : One of the best resort I have seen so far... And people at place are very nice... Nice spot for quite workouts and right place for family stay... Above all service is quick and good... Only thing is little more boards are required to reach easily. Good : The overall experience of the hotel was good. Clean. Calm. Wish to come back for next holidays. A really beautiful area, and a simple but nice guest\",\n",

Excellent place to stay for family or couple : Excellent place to stay for family or couple, very good food & friendly staff. I stayed with my family members. The place is very attractive and beautiful. The rooms were very clean and neat. The balcony was really good to sit outside and the river facing apartment we stayed, was really fantastic. Great place to connect with nature : Hotel is set in the peaceful abode of nature. Room is very spacious and have great view. Really enjoyed rain sitting in the balcony and overlooking the stream and beautiful trees. An excellent tracking in the forest plantation owned by resort. Average Stay : Overall good stay, enjoyed. Would suggest to friends. Nice location, good staff good food : It was a good stay. A very nice welcome. very good : food was good staff was co-operative beautiful location complimented with a good staff : Situated amidst the beautiful Munnar valley, this resort was a treat to my eyes. Resort is in the outskirts of munnar but the ride to resort is pleasant. We had 3 royal suites here. Rooms were spacious with a separate sitting and dining area but the best part was the balcony with the view of green mountains and a small stream flowing by. Premises are clean and a good children\\'s area is maintained along with a badminton court. However lack of swimming pool, spa and a club room was a dampner although the manager Ajish told us they are on it. Staff was very courteous and co-operative and made you feel like home. The resort owner himself interacted with us about our stay. Room service was good. The house keeping was nice (they made a cute baby elephant out of towels in childrens room which they loved :D) Food was average. Breakfast buffet had a wide variety which was good but dinner buffet can be improved i guess. Also the fishing area needs to be maintained. Overall my stay was very pleasant and if in Munar I would definitely like to stay here. Excellent Stay : Our experience at the Rivulet Resort was wonderful. The location, view and the ambience of the resort is excellent. The staff was very warm, helpful and courteous. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. We would definitely recommend this resort to our friends. PLEASANT : THE 20 % ADDITIONAL CHARGE FOR ROOM SERVICE DID NOT MATCH MY EXPECTATION Excellent Stay : Best of all resorts I have visited. Good Stay : Courteous staff. Good ambiance. An ideal holiday place, cozy and exotic resort. Comfortable and plush rooms with modern amenities and personalised care. Everything else in between such as Boom boo rafting etc which makes your stay more pleasurable when you are on leisure. Good Stay : Rivulet Resort is a hotel. Excellent location (but far from Munnar city) close to river, forest and mountain. In our Kerala trip we enjoy most in Munnar. Food quality is good and staff is also very cooperative. If you don\\'t enjoy travelling in mountain than this is not a good option. Excellent Stay : Really awesome experience. The resort has its own plantation and is spread over a huge area having tea gardens, pepper and cocoa plantation which was beautiful. There is a rivulet flowing by which was even more beautiful. The rooms were marvelous and huge. The food spread was luxurious and too good. Good Stay : Excellent place to stay. I stayed for 3 days and enjoyed lot the river. Bamboo boat, fishing point and so sweet environment. Great location with spacious room : Needs improvement on Games room & food menu Good Stay : Exceptional stay. Hospitality is their advantage. Place is beautiful, rooms are well kept, actually very well kept. Couldn\\'t forget the stay. It was very memorable. Its worth a stay. Worth every penny, just every penny. Excellent Stay : Located in a serene atmosphere, surrounded by deep jungles, a natural rivulet flowing on the back side down below, prominently visible on sitting in the balcony. The suit consists of a big sitting room with a fairly large bedroom and bathroom, all are new and maintained absolutely neat and clean. A large well furnished and equipped dining area, with superb spread of breakfast. The staff are helpful and cordial. I wi',\n",

We were given room and staff was really helpful. A great place to stay and will definitely recommending it to friends and family. Another good thing is that the owner will meet and greet the guests. good location breathtaking views but poor house keeping and food : The resort has excellent location and breathtaking views, great place to be with nature. However, I do think the following needs attention Housekeeping needs improvement. The rooms never look spic and span and the bathrooms need proper cleaning as well. your staff needs training and probably a supervisor to check the quality of cleaning/work. Food quality and presentation needs improvement. The dinning room does not look fresh and welcoming . Particularly because table cloths are not changed regularly and they have marks/stains and again floors are not cleaned properly. If you can improve these they will go a long way in making your resort better. simply refreshing..... : The most interesting part was the ambiance of the resort. It was exactly like what is available on resort website. It took us two days to explore only the resort . The garden, the river behind the cottage, forest everything was amazingly beautiful. The other most interesting thing was the staff. Loved the hospitality. We have traveled so much in India but the staff of Rivulet were so kind and polite which we rarely find especially in north hill stations. They are always ready to serve us. Coconuts, jack fruit and spices are everywhere in the resort. Even the local taxi drivers were also very polite and helpful. The taxi driver we had hired were so helpful and entertaining that we loved them. The only little (mind it a little one) problem was food . Although they tried hard to cook delicious food but some of the cuisines didnt match our expectations. The problem is not with the chef but with the culture differences we have. Like we don't prefer coconut that much in our recipes which they do. But overall we have managed by selecting cuisines from the menu card and by discussing with the chef of course. wonderfull experience. : Mr. Ajay manager of the resort is cool guy, he arranged every thing what we wanted very well, thanks to him. Resort location is awesome, cottages are big and clean, every thing was nice and I have no words to say but I would like to go once more to this resort. BIGGGGGG Thanks To Makemytrip for suggesting this resort. Average Stay : Rated location as average since it was very hard to get to but I believe that may be the case for most hotels in the area. Both me and my son get car sick and motion sickness so it was a bit challenging due to all the windy roads. Staff was very friendly and hospitable. Rooms were comfortable and clean. Food was okay. Some items were more enjoyable than others but I think the flavors could be improved. There is a children play area which my son 1.5 years old enjoyed. I just wish they had a small gate at the entrance since he liked escaping to the road. Luckily there is little traffic but still had to keep chasing him. Poor Stay : Food was bad so does staff we have not enjoyed our stay there. Not recommended at all. It was unsafe and bad hospitality. Location was so far from the city, nothing nearby and a very bad approach. Will not recommend to anyone. Food option was limited and I got upset stomach due to it. Poor Stay : Not a 4 star hotel by any chance. This one. Loads of insects everywhere and no facilities for a 4 star resort to remove those. Many equipments was broken, partially used or not working in the rooms. Not good for a 2 day stay. Plus too far from anywhere. Poor Stay : The worst thing was food quality, we are 24 member and out of 24, 22 member suffered in 3 day staying by vomiting. Food quality is very bad so please do not go in this resort. Good Stay : All was good except the location was about 20 Kms away from Munnar. The hospitality and services were good. I feel one day was not enough to get value of such a resort. Even the season was quite warm. May be I would like to visit this place again in December and January tim\",\n",

Park was good and room location is, also good with balcony. The view was awesome and provided all the tea materials to enjoy. Good Stay : Stayed for one night. Location was very good. View from the room was beautiful, dinner was tasty, and staff were helpful. They serve breakfast a little late, at 8 am, but as we had to check out early, they packed some breakfast for us to have on the way. Overall, we are happy with our experience at the hotel. Good Stay : I really loved my stay there. What a location it was. Mountains, spring and trees all around. Staff was very friendly. Food was awesome. They have small adventurous activities like bamboo rafting and nature walk. Rooms are spacious, neat and clean. Very good resort. Good Stay : It is really a place which we enjoyed, specially the walk in the Spice Garden by the operation manager. Bit far off from regular crowd of Munnar, need to go during monsoon. Though the road is bad leading the hotel but the view is worth every penny. Great hotel to again stay. Good Stay : Great experience. The best part of this hotel is the location, there is no doubt about that. The staff were good, it was well maintained and everything was good. Only issue was with the food, its not bad its just it was not up to the expectation as all other things were very good. Good Stay : Had a great experience. The resort was surrounded by its own tea pepper and cocoa plantation. Loved the cottages! The cottages were huge and marvelous. Location of the cottages were river facing which added to our delight. Ambience was great. Food was average though. Loved the place! Excellent Stay : Food was good. Staff behavior was good. Everything was perfect and location was perfect. Good Stay : Well, almost everything was perfect. I just wish the WiFi was better. The food options can also be improved. Otherwise everything was quite good.

Ambiance place with nice view. Perfect location for city walks and day trips. Typical Kerela graciousness and warmth, the perfect stay! Sorry to say but personally I do not like the food anymore. Excellent Stay : One of the best hotels to stay, though its far from munnar main city, but the small river facing cottages and scenic beauty around it are worth paying for. Excellent: 1. Room Service 2. Food 3. SPA Rivulet Resort is the first hotel in our short trip and it really worth staying there. Pleasant stay, friendly staff's, ambience was fantastic : River view was awesome and integral part of the stay. good location : Very good location but little far from Munnar.Best to get relax yourself. Good Stay : Located in a beautiful place, nice views on all sides, especially river, lake, mountain, tea garden etc. Food quality is average though variety was available. Good hospitality, neat and clean, overall excellent experience. Given option, would visit again. Good Stay : This place is not in Munnar but it is in Chithirapuram which is 11 km away from Munnar town. The resort is just too too awesome but if you do not have a rental car, its a bit difficult to commute from this place. You may not get rickshaw in the evening to come back to resort as its away from Munnar town. Still its an amazing resort to relax and take a break and do nothing. Good Stay : The property is very good and the hospitality and ambience are perfect. Rooms are nice and clean and are on a island. Restaurant serves good food. Ch\",\n",

Staff were very friendly and made our stay enjoyable. The owner personally came around checking if everything was alright.

Very nice location . : Good rooms, nice location , friendly staff - good value for money. Food needs improvement . Excellent Stay : Really awesome experience.

The rooms were marvelous and huge. The food spread was luxurious and too good. Excellent Stay : Overall experience in the hotel was good. Very good maintenance and awesome : This resort has overcome my expectations during the stay. The maintenance is not compromised. Food is awesome. Only thing missing is the SPA and Pool which is under construction. Looking forward to come again. Best resort and I strongly recommend. Poor Stay : 1. Please make the bar facility available. 2. Variety of food served was quite bad. Nature's Abode : Waking up with the rivulet singing in our ears was an amazing feeling. The scenic beauty and the hide and seek game played by the mist was unforgettable. Good Stay : Food facility was very good. Staff Behaviour was attractive to customers. The room given for accommodation was very good. All was very good. If any body as for good resort in Munnar means I will recommend for rivulet resort.

We had booked Honeymoon suite. It has great view. Food is very good. Chicken is not that fresh. However fish, egg items and other vegetarian and soup items are very good. Breakfast has a lot of varieties and all are very tasty. Very good hospitality. Resort is very far from Munnar city, apart from that everything is fine. Good Stay : It was such a wonderful experience with Rivulet resort that it really becomes tough to wrap the whole experience in words. Awesome is the most fittest word right now. Every thing from the start of the stay till the end was superb including the place, view, rooms, service, facilities etc. Looking forward to plan another trip to Munnar and stay here as soon as possible. Cheers!! Enjoyable : Enjoyable Worth staying in this beautiful resort .. : Good location and property..had a great experience exploring the property and its surroundings.. Poor Stay : Was not good at all as it is out of city and food was also was not good at all. Everything is so far and staff behavior is also not up-to the mark and if food is not good its useless to live in this hotel. Location is okay but main thing is food not recommended to the other. Awesome hotel , food menu could be better, : Awwsome location of the hotel , with very nice built cottages. Good Stay : Our experience at Rivulet was excellent. Hotel staff were very co operative and made our stay delightful. We planned to stay in Rivulet for one day only as Rivulet was far from Munnar but after reaching rivulet we extended our stay for another one day. Will definitely recommend this hotel.

The rooms, view, hospitality, food everything so so awesome. I wish to stay here every time I visit Munnar. Stay not worth : Located some 15-20 Km away from Munnar town, no facility to commute to and from hotel. They charge you separately. No facilities in the hotel for any recreation. It's only the view which is worth but that every hotel will offer you. Excellent property and excellent service : Starting from checkin in to checkout.

Love you Swiiss County Stay at Swiss County hotel : It was a pleasant stay, but they don't have food variety in veg. Great stay in about 30 minutes from Munnar : Stayed at Alpine suite in Swiss county. Suite is a large and clean room. Views from hotel are hills and not Munnar valley with tea estates as we expected but they are great. Even views from room top restaurant are great with hills covered with clouds. Staff are extremely kind and friendly. Kudos for their hospitality 10/10 for that. I would definitely recommend staying at Swiss county unless some one expects Munnar tea estates and valley view from their room. Outstanding : The hotel cleanliness, staff. Overall it was amazing.

Good Stay : Good stay clean and neat hotel staff is very courteous and good Best value for money hotel in Munnar near Chittirapuram : We stayed in Apline suite room for 3 nights. The room is located beside the reception and is huge room with a balcony has a beautiful view. Staff behaviour - 5/5, Food - 4/5 Coming from Andhra, we liked almost all the dishes they we had tried fish, fried rice, paratha, chapati, veg manchuria, gobhi manchuria, chicken biriyani, almost all breakfast items that they had. You can rely on this hotel for food. Wifi is just ok and TV is too small for the room. All the toiletries are available in the wash room. Overall 5/5.

       "  ' there for one night and it was a very nice experience. Especially staffs are highly cooperating and helpful. Had pleasant time with no disturbances : Swiss County is one of the best hotels where you could find friendly staffs in all 24 hours in a day. They treated me as their own guest from the start till the last bye. Perfect in room service with no unnecessary disturbances. Security helped me with all local places and planning my trip to Munnar was very easy. Rooms are perfectly clean and exactly as shown in the pictures. Food is costly but no complaints in the quality and service. Even served laundry service, a special request for honeymoon couples, etc! Good Stay : Overall very good hotel service location and quality were very good. A pleasant getaway : Swiss county located at Chithirapuram is a pleasant stay. The rooms with mountain view are quite an experience. The serene, calm locale can soothe your senses. Alphorn restaurant offers food that is tasty and well prepared. The staff is really courteous and well mannered. Go for it. As a couple or family, you will enjoy the stay. Rude manager : My child mistakenly scribbled on the wall and we were to inform the manager about it. But the manager was not at seat in the morning. At evening when we returned he burst out on me that \"you will have to pay for that and you should have seen to your child. U haven\\'t informed us\". I was an alone lady and my hubby was out for some work. Still, he blasted on me. Very disappointed and not recommend. Need serious apology and I even said that it is just done by pencil we are very sorry for that but he was not ready to listen even. Amazing stay : Great service and hospitality. It was really good. Food was great. Wifi connection is really weak : Just an issue with internet connectivity rest all are awesome Excellent stay : I stayed in alpine suite. The rooms were very comfortable, big and clean added to that excellence. The services was awesome. Positive and friendly staff. Location is good as it is far from the hustle and bustle of Town. Swiss County made me feel like home. The host specially Mr. Beenu was awesome and a very good human being. Food was fantastic. Keep it up Swiss County Munnar. Awesome stay : We booked the alpine suite. And it was amazing. They have super fast room service and even night service so it\\'s basically 24/7. Housekeeping was really good and everyday our room would be fully cleaned and stocked while we were out sightseeing. They provide all amenities like ac, hot water, tissues, dental kit, shaving kit, shower caps and other toiletries. There\\'s a fridge and microwave in the room so we reheated food that was left over from the meal before and thus minimal wastage. The view from the balcony is too good especially since you would literally be waking up to that panorama every morning. The bed\\'s super comfy and there\\'s a couch and tv to lounge in as well. In short, this was the best part of our stay and totally value for money. Nice experience : While booking Swiss County I really not much satisfied but after going to reality totally different experience. Food ambiance the way how staff received totally satisfied 5/5 Recommended to others visiting Munnar : Hotel provides scenic view of mountains right from the balcony. Hotel staff and manager was very courteous and made sure that we have comfortable stay. Hotel is around 11 km from City center which actually cuts off any unwanted City traffic and noise. I will definitely recommend this hotel to others visiting Munnar. Great service, staff are really helpful : Our full travel was totally taken care by the hotel. They even had two cycle which they gave us for free. Good breakfast. Lovely view from the balcony The perfect room, extremely friendly hotel staff, and complete vale for money : The Swiss County, like a mini chalet, can boast of a complete family like atmosphere, smiling faces all around and everyone willing to assist you to the best extent possible. The property, both exterior and interior, seems in almost like new condition, very clean and well maintained. The best part of our stay was the Alpine Suite Room. Very large, including a lounge & sitting area, a pantry, bedroom and private balcony. The pantry includes amenities like a microwave, kettle, refrigerator, and a kitchen sink. All basic amenities are provided. The bedroom is just alongside the balcony with full glass sliding doors, and the view from therein is breathtaking too. There are 2 alpine suite rooms, 105 & 106, both with the same ',\n",
       "  \"construction and view. The hotel can arrange for private tours, and can even call an auto rickshaw if you want a little excursion to the nearby tea estates and view points. The hotel also provides their own bicycles in case you need one. The food is good, served with delight. The chef has mastered continental dishes and thus it was a delight to try both Indian and Continental cuisine. A special mention needs to be made about staff friendliness. It felt like a home, away from home. Every single person, from the hotel manager to the service staff endeavored their best to satisfy the guests in every possible way. Terrific service : Service provided by the hotel was terrific. Rooms were really good but not at all value for money. You could easily get a 5 star hotel at the same price. Happy stay at Swiss County : Scenic view. Delicious vegetarian food. Courteous staff. Overall Nice experience. Excellent Stay : Wow place, a short boutique hotel but huge from inside must visit Excellent Stay : Good food and staff. Nice spacious room and cleanliness Amazing hospitality! : Hotel staff were extremely polite and professional. Especially, Binu and Piyush. Other service staff were good as well. Alpine suite is extremely spacious and luxurious. Although there are couple of areas of improvement. The hotel should install a 43 inch or a bigger television which would go well with the size of the suite. The hotel must connect to a HD set top box and HD channels. World-wide channels should be added, instead of local south indian channels. Another aspect which requires attention is the quality of food. All the chinese and south indian dish tastes alike. The cost of the food is also not so reasonable. However, I will still rate Swiss County as one of my best stay in Kerala so far. Good : The overall experience at Swiss County was good! Good Stay : Very peaceful place and good food. Great stay at Swiss County : Good spacious rooms. Nice food. Staff are friendly and helpful. In future also I will prefer Swiss County in my Munnar visit It was just ok : Location view and staff were good. Room need upgradation. Need maintenance for room paint, bathroom and electrical appliances. Tidy setup with a picturesque view from the balcony : Location you get a breathtaking view of the mountains from your balcony. It was worth every bit of the penny. My family loved it. 5/5 for the location. Food you need to expand your data log. Not sure why the buffet offering was missing while we could see the setup in the restaurant. Service we had to ask the staff for the basics like hot water, movement of bags. Management must take proactive measures to improve their score on such experiences. Excellent : Alpine suite is very spacious. Excellent Stay : It's an excellent experience. Excellent Stay : If u are with family this hotel is best for you. Specially the view and the staff very humble and polite and service is excellent also very good food. Go for it without any hesitation. Excellent Stay : Nice hotel, no pool, little disappointed with kids playing area Not a great place to spend holidays : The location of the hotel is quite far from town and is at a very lonely place with no restaurant or shops nearby. No place in the hotel nor nearby to roam around in the evening. The area is totally deserted after 10 Pm. Deluxe (without balcony) rooms are terrible as they are in basement and no view from windows. They are a big no for anyone wants to spend a holiday at a good hotel. Hotel has only 8 rooms and has no recreational facilities. This should not be a not a good star hotel. Staff is polite and service is good. Good hotel, good food and pleasant location : Good hotel, good food and pleasant location Good Stay : Everything can be rated as average and description of hotel amenities must be made clear like minibar but all paid drinks, cookies they charge it. It needs a good briefing. Overall good. Excellent Stay : The hotel offers great hospitality with a nice view from the balcony. Suite rooms are big and spacious. Food was good and reasonably priced Peaceful getaway : Superior view from the balcony, great infrastructure, delicious food. This place has extremely helpful and friendly staff. They have helped us a lot with sight seeing. Breakfast menu was exceptional. Valley view from the balcony is cherry on the top. I would big time recommend this place.

This is situated little far from Munnar Town, but the ambience and service both are great. Stay in Swiss County : Excellent experience. They upgraded our room and provided all the information needed to plan itinerary Excellent Stay : Good food, peaceful stay, helpful staff Excellent all round hotel : I own 2 hotels, soi know a good one when I see it, feel it. At check-in the staff were super nice. They kept assisting and were polite and customer oriented throughout our stay.

Amazing : Each and everything about Swiss County is great Location, staff, food, rooms, and the view from the room is bonus Loved it : Great view from the room. Very humble and polite staff.

Good hotel and room to stay. Simply amazing stay : Swiss county lives up to its ratings and reviews, it was truly a wonderful experience there. The room, staff, food and hospitality is surely 5/5. The manager is very genuine and helpful person and took care of all the basics during our stay. We stayed in suite which has all the amenities and amazing view. The food and hospitality is exceptional. Its 20 minutes away from Munnar Town and gives you calm and clean vibes. Don't compare it with big hotel chains but for a quite and warm stay choose this place with eyes closed. I will recommend this place to all travelers who likes a break from busy life's and wants to enjoy a beautiful stay. A five star service in budget : We stayed for two days and we can not ask for a better experience for our Kerala trip. Staff was courteous, prompt service and specially the suits. The balcony is very huge and has Valley view, rooms are spacious with all modern amenities. Recommend to everyone specially couples for pleasant stay. Excellent Stay : View was amazing. Nice management. Very helpful faculty. Everything was up-to mark : Good reception, good staff, good rooms, breakfast was excellent, though not a buffet but we food want we ordered and was very good. Dinner options were less but food was tasty and served nice. Excellent Stay : Food is excellent. If you are a looking for a place with a great view and a balcony, this is it. The rooms are well-maintained and the staffs are very polite and friendly. Average stay. Feel like home stays : Feel like home stays. 12 km from munnar main town. Hotel location exactly on the main road. Very costly buffet. Hotel has only 7 rooms. Staff is very good. Very large balconies. The location of Swiss county is not so good. It's 12 km before munnar main town. Moreover, the pictures shown by hotel are really attractive, but actually it's not so good. In pictures, it looks like the entire outside area is private property of hotel, but no. It's on the main road. Rooms balconies are very good and spacious and opens towards valley. Staff is very good but buffet is very costly. No other facilities in hotel. You will feel more like home stays not a proper hotel. Excellent Stay : Awesome, thanks for your ambience.

       "  \"for money stay. Room is definitely a premium one. Good size bed and a decent view from the balcony food is also good service is also good. It was amazing hotel. Small : It was amazing hotel. Small property having only 7 rooms but exceptionally clean and good. Rooms were super spacious and with clean and big washrooms. Hill view balcony and garden view entrance if you take ground floor. The only thing I didn't like is if you stay at ground floor and want to go roof top restaurant so there is NO LIFT in the hotel. I think that too manageable but depending on personal choice and 2nd thing food preparation smell was too strong in the Stairs area. Room service was a Not good at all, food service is pathetic, far away : Hotel is far away from Munnar town, no nearby facilities available, food service is pathetic and the attitude of food guy is pathetic, rest of the staff is fine, don't serve anything in night, so please people stay away from this Exquisite is the word : I wanted to give 6 for extremely well trained and courteous staff. The location is good but rest all things are more than perfect. Located very close to top view points in Munnar. View from hotel is not breathtaking but satisfying Modern room with good facilities. : Rooms are neat and service is good. You can make use of cycles as well which is available in the resort itself. The pics uploaded here are of Alpine suite. People looking for relaxation can opt for this resort as it is 8 km away from Munnar town. Exceptionally good place to stay : It is a Very good place to stay. Reasonable distance from all the 'to go' places. Food is exceptionally good at their costs. I have been to 'the Panoramic View ' Lounge in Munnar which is a very good lounge but a bit costly. I thought I got the same quality food in Swiss County hotel for a cheaper cost, although the Menu here is limited. The view from there is mind blowing. We get a very good view. Their interiors design of the rooms and their decoration with lily flowers is praiseworthy. They could take care of the smell of the lily flowers if possible, all people may not like the smell all the time. Just a suggestion, in case. But the Overall stay was amazing. Fantastic stay in Munnar : Staying in the resort obviously adds extra value to your trip. The resort earns full marks in every parameter and in every aspects right from services to food qualities, hospitality, panoramic views from the balcony and the roof. In the entire trip starting from Kochi to Kovalam we had the best stay in this resort and really delighted that we selected Swiss County in our itinerary. The resort is extremely cosy and compact. I would suggest every travellers to keep Swiss County at top of the chart while searching accommodation in Munnar. Superb room : The room was very nice and the staff was also very helpful. They arranged for a cake at 12 of my husband's birthday but the location is a little far from Munnar station and the temperature is a little high here One of the Best Hotels : The hotel is well situated and the view from the rooms is just awesome... The staff right from the receptionist to the Doorman is highly professional and courteous.. I loved the food... The hospitality... To sum up it was just amazing... If you want to have the best stay in Munnar.. Look no further. Good family hotel. : Good for family. Good staff behavior. Food is only average. The bed size is very small and for a family of 2+1 it will be very tight. Need to climb all the way up to top floor for breakfast. The view from the room and top floor is excellent and will enjoy it. Unique theme of Swiss Charlet is fabulous! : We booked this hotel based on the reviews and make my trip assured hotel tag. The hotel reminded us of the Switzerland which we had visited last year. Same kind of ambience and service! True to its name I would recommend it for couple and family travelers. Fantastic Stay : This small 7-8 rooms cozy hotel or a boutique hotel is in the lap of Munnar 's hills, view from the rooms facing hills is awesome, rooftop restaurant will takes you close to feel the freshness ad nature. In and all a fantastic place to stay. Good stay, clean rooms with decent view. : Good stay, clean rooms with decent view. Service was to the mark. Though buffet was not available, a la carte was decent. More games could be included like table tennis. They have carrom and cycling for now. Wonderful to spend time with your loved ones : The hotel looks exactly same as you see in pictures. Food is excellent. Room service a\",\n",
       "  \"nd hospitality was up to satisfying. You get enough privacy to spend time with your loved ones I'll recommend Swiss county for all my friends and family. Only +ve about this hotel is the view from room : I booked this hotel based on the great ratings of this hotel given at trip advisor but I was disappointed with the poor service and lack of facilities at this hotel. Main disadvantages are mentioned below: 1) This hotel doesn't have any lift. Only stairs. Definitely not suitable for senior citizens or disabled persons. It was too inconvenient for my mother due to her old age. 2) No staff at reception before 7 AM. This is the hotel's rule. So if you face any problem during early morning hours, you'll have to wait till 7 or 7:30 AM till someone resumes his duty at reception. 3) The hotel had problems with hot water and water pressure was too low in the shower. 4) This hotel provides 1 bottle of drinking water per person in a day. We were a 3 members family and the hotel provided us with 3 bottles of water in a day. If you need more water then you need to buy it from the hotel or bring it from outside. This is the strict policy of this hotel and they won't provide more than 1 bottle of water for free to each guest in a day. 5) The location of this hotel is not good at all. Reaching to this hotel is a too difficult task itself. Very narrow and dangerous road. Excellent and spacious rooms with superb views : Though there are only 7 rooms in this Hotel but all rooms except 1 have a fantastic view of the hills and valley. Hotel is 10 kms from Munnar city. Rooma are quiet big and spacious. Food is good, but service is little slow but tolerable. Overall bets value for money.

Ambience is awesome hospitality and Hil type Resort. Staff behaviour is awesome. Hospitality is very courteous. Good : Overall good, view climate and location. Good stay but service needs upgrade : We visited Munnar during February 2020 end. The rooms are large and clean. The spacious balcony is one of the best features. The lights in the room are quite dim, they should be upgraded. The fan was moving very slowly and it was a bit warm, so we asked room service to rectify the problem. We were provided with a room fan. The geyser in one of our rooms wasn't working properly and although it was rectified quickly. These are the little things that a hotel can fix in a permanent manner. I wasn't provided the Wi-Fi password until the next morning and I had to complain twice for it. It was needed since there was a network problem. These were not big matters but they add up. Besides these, the stay was good. One more thing and although it wasn't the fault of the resort, the road to the resort seemed to me quite difficult and dangerous. Excellent Stay : It was overall a great experience staying there however, the rooms are not very nicely maintained. Good trip : The view from resort is really breathtaking. Splendid tea plantation and deep valley view from our balcony. Food was okay and takes time to prepare if ordered. So, traveler needs to order 30 minutes prior proceeding to restaurant. Staff behavior and services are good. Connecting road from highway need to earmarked. Overall nice and suitable for all. Tea Valley : Nice place. Great location. Cleanliness amazing. Great food. Awesome property : Simply wow. The resort is located in Amidst Tea Gardens and at a high altitude giving breathtaking views. Though the accessibility to the resort is through narrow road but the pick and drop facility arranged by the resort makes it easy and convenient to reach there.

Amazing view surrounded by sloppy Tea gardens ambient weather and staff service is excellent. Overall Worth visiting once Nice location : Hotel is in very nice location and hospitality is good 2 day stay : I liked the clean rooms, attached balcony and location. Staff are also nice. What I don't like is food which is one of the important thing for me. Food is average, plus the road which is connected to hotel is very narrow and has many bumpers which is not safe in night time. Overall good stay. Hotel view and rooms 9 out of 10. Cleaning 8 out 10. Staff 9 out 10 and food 5 out 10. Awesome honeymoon stay at Tea Valley : It was really an awesome stay at Tea Valley, the staff, specially Mr. Suresh was very co operative and arranged everything for us. The behavior of staff is really good. Will surely visit next time with my entire family and will also recommend the same to my other friends. Keep it up Tea Valley. Awesome hotel room and view : All things are too good. Location, food and service are awesome : This resort is good for 1 or 2 days. I stayed here 3 days then last day service is too bad. There was no cleaning of room. Mesmerising location : I enjoyed the place so much, I can't express in words. It is situated in an isolated place which is so beautiful that you don't feel like going anywhere. Just one thing they need to take care about is the maintenance of their rooms, bathroom and recreation area. Rooms are little old and bathrooms are not up to the mark. Rest all the view, location, food, people everything is just amazing. Nice location : Gre\",\n",

Cleanliness : The location of the hotel is very good. Rooms are stinky. Very nice resort : Stayed 2 nights, ambience is very good. Nice view from balcony. Very good hospitality. The road leading to resort is very narrow and one should be careful while driving. Please ask the resort for directions as Google Maps will mislead you. Excellent Stay : Very good stay will recommend Beautiful and romantic : Place was a stunner, must visit. Awesome view : View from the hotel is very nice and the staff is awesome. Hotel is a bit inside and narrow lanes need good driving skills. Otherwise, it's good resort to relax and chill. Breakfast was good but dinner needs bit improvement. Nice resort with good view : Everything was superb, including food, the only drawback was they made us to wait for check-in around 30 minutes, otherwise finest resort to stay in Munnar. Excellent Stay : Located in Tea plantation area you can travel Around Tea plantation Very good service, : Nice place to stay, climate was very good, affordable price for rooms and location is too good, Poor : Poor stay. Worst day of my life. Good property, poor service : Stay is comfortable. But service is not good. Food is okay Excellent Stay : Very nice place to enjoy your holidays Tea Valley experience : I traveled in Feb 20. Had a super amazing experience. Staffs at Tea Valley very helpful and nice. Awesome location for family : Awesome location but reaching here after 6 pm is tough. Flooring in rooms is old and stick, key needs to be replaced. Awesome location and helpful staff : The place is isolated from city traffic situated in a calm and peaceful location view from all the rooms is amazing. Staff is really helpful and they take immediate action on your request. I will definitely stay at the same place if I visit Munnar again. Good facility : Nice view from balcony. Hygiene maintenance is good. Outstanding ambiance and customer service : I am a vivid traveller but hardly get to experience customer service as personalized as this. Ahkil specially took care of all our arrangements personally even when he was on leave. Also, the person at the reception, chef and person who served us were extremely curteous. Resort is so very beautifully maintained that it reminded me of resorts in any rain forests or Bali. I booked the tree house in the property for our anniversary dinner, it was one of the most exotic ambiance I have ever experienced. It was cherry on the cake for us. View from the room was breath taking. Maps location is incorrect but the above mentioned people guided me and it's not hard to locate. Booked taxi at the resort for local tour which was worth it. Drivers were very curteous. One of them even washed my own car while checking out, how nice of them! They even arranged for a drop as the approach road is very narrow. Cons: Approach road speically if you going after sunset. Our room was in the 5th level (not floor, all levels have inclined path way with full of plans and 4-creeper) so was very difficult to commute between room and restraunt, reception. They should have \",\n",
       "  \"lift. Breakfast had options in Indian cusine but lacked continental options like flavoured yogurt and oats. But I would recommend this report any day. Thank you! Average stay : Strange Road without any signboard or direction to the hotel. Rooms requires more cleanliness. Anode amidst mountains : A perfect get away in the lap of nature away from the mundane metro life. Co-operative friendly staff and excellent ambience. Strongly recommended. Peaceful stay : The property is situated inside a tea estate and naturally the stay is very peaceful. The rooms had very good view as well. Staff were polite and the resort had good amount of activities as well. The only drawback was the property was bit old and hence the room maintenance was average, but the resort makes it up with the price point it is placed at. Overall worth the money spent. Excellent stay : Staff was very friendly. Food quality was excellent. Neat and clean room. Bonfire was very good. Stay here for the view : Probably the most beautiful view that any hotel would have to offer. The hotel is a little secluded but the view makes it Worth it. There's not much to do though in the room as the internet is slow. It's clean and safe. Food is slightly better than average. So not go there during the summer as there's no ac in any of the rooms. Munnar tea garden visit : Location was great for the resort. The room was spacious too. Although the furniture was very old and needs renovation. Breakfast was very good. Lunch and dinner was okay. Vegetarian and specially North Indian food was okay. I would rather suggest to stick to the dal and rice cuisine or non veg food if you eat it. WiFi was a big problem. Kept connecting and disconnecting. Also the network for Vodafone wasn't great either so internet usage did hamper over at the resort. Staff was very kind and polite. There was lot of peace and the stay was very relaxing. So if you are looking to relax this is the spot for you. Stay at Tea Valley resort : We drove zoom car to resort, last 2 km was an adventurous, narrow road. Hospitality, location of the resort, staff behaviour 5/5. They auto-updated us to luxury suite, view from the resort is mesmerizing. Mesmerising view and excellent staff service : Our recent stay at the Tea Valley resort was superb. The room was comfortable, the clean best part is the balcony and the view beyond. The main attractions are the bonfire (in the evening time), Treetop house. We planned for a surprise anniversary room decor for my sister & brother in law, which was coordinated by Lijo & team. It couldn't be better. They arranged everything beyond our expectations. Lijo, Bijay, Akhil & others were always helpful in attending our requests. Nice Resort with beautiful view : Nice Resort with beautiful view. Very clean. Well mannered staff Rejuvenating : I stayed in the executive cottage for 2 nights and it was truly awesome. Though it is little outside from the city but everything was quite perfect. Quite relaxing. View from balcony was worth of every penny spent for this booking. Stay in the lap of Tea garden : Beautiful tea garden view from terrace. Food quality is average. staff behavior is good. Ultimate place to stay in nature : If you want to feel nature in Munnar then you have to stay in Tea Valley Resort. The resort have own adventure activities. Excellent hotel : Hotel is built on the hill with an exce\",\n",

Worth staying : Tea Valley Resort have excellent natural ambience. Their staff and services are appreciable. We enjoyed our stay and I recommend this Resort to natural beauty lovers. A heavenly Resort in nature's lap : I stayed here for 3 nights which I felt was less to do justice to this place. What a beautiful mesmerising place built surrounded by Tea estate all around. I could not take my eyes off from the HD colors of the flowers and plants all over the Resort. About food and restaurant, buffet breakfast is a blast and a food lover's treat. With all the options like aloo paratha, curd, idli, dosa, bread, butter, honey, jam, Tea/coffee, poori bhaji ch hole etc, one cannot decide what to eat and what to skip. There's something for everyone. Restaurant's menu items are also very tasty. We enjoyed a lot. Total area of this Resort is very big and it has an adventurous small trek that you can explore and reach to the top where there is a sunrise point. You can See ducks and other small creatures on this way. Security is up to the mark. Rooms are very large with all modern amenities and a big personal balcony with a Valley view. Completely relaxed and satisfied. There was a campfire organised on a big terrace with DJ music and we all rocked the floor with our moves. The setup was good. All these facilities are included in your stay. All the staff, be it reception, restaurant, housekeeping, security and others, were very polite and always happy to serve you. Thank you very much for making our stay a truly memorable one. Excellent Stay : Its a nice place to be in. In the middle of the Tea garden and very close to the nature.

No need to roam anywhere to be with nature Excellent Stay : Fantastic stay there, staff is very nice and food quality is good Pleasant stay : Beautiful atmosphere, calm place and an awesome room Great stay : The location, service, food quality, interior and near by area is very good.

Great ambience and scenic beauty. Food is excellent Great view. Separate Balcony : Room service was average, for ordering tea, towels, or any requirements I called 2 to 3 times, in short late service, but staffs are very courteous, well-behaved, you need to be prompt for being excellent. Location - Please don't book here if you're planning for Kolukkumalai Jeep safari as roads are under construction it take 1/2 hour more in the morning to reach Suryanelli 30 km - 40 km. Even standard rooms are provided with balcony which has amazing view loved it. Breakfast variety decent, but whate\",\n",

They arranged for a site seeing also. Short 2 days stay at Tea Valley : The rooms are very spacious but need regular maintenance.

Great location : Great food, great service, overall great experience. Peaceful : Peaceful relaxing stay! Good delicious! Service prompt! Staff courteous! Awesome view of sunset from the hotel : The best part of the hotel is the delightful view from the large balcony of the room. We stayed on the second floor overlooking tea gardens in the valley. Experiencing sunset from our room balcony was awesome. Food was really good and tasty. Staff was friendly. We could not experience sports activities unique to the hotel due to unavailability of trainer on account of strike in Kerala. Excellent Stay : It was a great stay. Ambience was awesome. Very picturesque location. Only the approach Road was difficult and tricky. Stay review : Overall the stay was very good. I would like to appreciate the staff who were very kind and approachable at any point of time. We had complimentary breakfast and separately ordered the dinner (ala-carte) and the taste was very good. Rooms had good view and very neat and clean. Evenings we could had a walk outside the resort and was very peaceful. The road which lead to the resort was narrow, but still enjoyed the drive :). I would highly recommend Tea Valley Resort.

Good Stay : Pleasant stay close to nature, peaceful, calm environment Perfect place to relax and rejuvenate : Stay was very comfortable, right in the middle of Tea garden. Food was average.

View from the balcony is mesmerizes everyone eyes. Staff behavior was good. They lack in some bathroom cleanliness. It's was not smells good the day we checked in.

Terrible food : The food which they served were not upto the mark. Kids play area was not working properly. Excellent Stay : Enjoyed my 2 days stay in the resort. Great place to stay with excellent view from the room of tea valley as well as of the hills. Support staff very cooperative. Only issue is with the approach road to reach the hotel. The driver of the cab needs to be an expert but once you are in the campus, relax and fully enjoy the scenic beauty of Munnar from the resort. Value for money. Awesome location : Nice location of hotel. Just improve infrastructure Worth a visit : If ever in Munnar, visit the hotel. Beautiful location and with many activities (we were there for just 2 days). No need to travel out and you can spend entire day at the hotel. Will visit for a longer stay in future. Tea Valley : Beautiful location but isolated and approach Road is dangerous. Not recommended for elderly as no lift. Food quality average. Staff was helpful Worst hotel I ever seen : Don't book this hotel we booked for two days but we can't able to sleep single night in this hotel. Room cleanliness is so poor even public wash room is good compare to this hotel. Property is good however service is terrible. Wifi not working. Mobile phone connectivity not there in room. Intercom not working. Hot water not coming. Quality of food is even not tasty : Property is good however service is terrible. Wifi not working. Mobile phone connectivity not there in room. Intercom not working. Hot water not coming. Quality of food is even not tasty. At tea plantation : Nice place to stay and food also good. Route to the hotel is bad. You can enjoy stay and tracking. Excellent : Great stay and good facilities Best hotel and location : Best hotel and location View is excellent Good place but not if you are looking to relax : If you are trying to find a place that lets you unwind after your daily city grind then this is not the place for you. The hotel location and facilities promise you of a great time but sadly do not deliver. On Christmas eve there was so much noise coming in from the dining area, music was being played so loud that my room with all the doors and windows shut, still managed to feel like an underground disco. I complained 4-5 times to the hotel to lower the volume of the music but it all fell on deaf ears. I will definitely not visit this hotel again. Excellent location : Very comfortable stay, very good staff behavior\",\n",

Awesome place : Tea Valley is a wonderful and lovely location, slightly away from the main town, the way to reach is slightly narrow but you can easily reach via taxi/car. But to get a nature view, location is obvious. It was a pleasant stay. Had camp fire as well in night. Food was good. Hospitality was very nice. Overall nice stay. Nice view with surrounding : Surrounding is very good and you have access to complete property. It\\'s good place to spend couple of days.

Hotel is surrounded by tea plantation, site view is so beautiful. Overall decent stay : The upside of this Resort is that it has absolutely stunning views, decent food and courteous staff.
